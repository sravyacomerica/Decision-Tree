• The Decision Tree Classifier makes use of python and its efficient data strutures to build a desicion tree from scratch. It takes a set of attributes as input and calculates their entropy and information gain.

• The attribute with highest information gain is selected and choosen as the splitting attribute. The process is repeated on all the attributes until there are no attributes left to split. At the leaf node the class that has highest occurence is used to predict the class.

• The decision tree is built and trained using a training set. After the tree is built a method calculates the accuracy of the predicted values by comparing them with the actual values.

• The built model in this project has acheived and accuracy on 75% on the training set and an accuracy of 70% on the test set.
